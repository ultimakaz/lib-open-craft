We are also going to try to include object scripting.


### UPDATES\*AND\*INFORMATION\*ON\*RELEASES ###

This weeks release includes all of before release plus more stable code
this does not include the bukkit plugin we have been working on since it is no were near ready or even usable but this build includes Saving and loading the world and chat commands have been fixed
API Documentation will be included in the wiki in less than 2 weeks.

PLEASE VIEW OUR WIKI for the plugin system, http://code.google.com/p/lib-open-craft/wiki/PluginSystem
our plugin system dynamically loads .dll files with the namespace/name of LibOpenCraft.something.dll
Please enjoy using our system and remember that you can drop as much modules as you want in, even if it's running it will rebuild the cache for modules and run the module or you can even delete it while it's running.
